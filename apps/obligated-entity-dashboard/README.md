# Demo Dashboard for Obliged Entities

This dashboard is going to be used by other obligated entities to list users's credentials and grant access to them.

Deployed at <https://obligated-entity-dashboard.vercel.app/>.

## Using a non-browser wallet

This app supports using Reown (formerly WalletConnect). This can be leveraged to have your wallet anywhere, including your own server. Be sure to check [their WalletKit documentation](https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/overview) to learn more.

If you want a quick web-only demo, you can use <https://react-wallet.walletconnect.com/> to try things out.
